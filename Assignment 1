Define Software Engineering:
Software Engineering is the systematic process of designing, developing, testing, and maintaining software. It aims to create high-quality, reliable, and maintainable software systems.
Unlike traditional programming, which focuses on writing code, software engineering encompasses a broader set of activities, including requirements analysis, design, testing, and ongoing maintenance1.
Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC):
The SDLC consists of several phases:
Requirements Gathering: Understanding user needs and defining system requirements.
System Design: Creating a high-level design, architecture, and data models.
Implementation (Coding): Writing the actual code based on the design.
Testing: Verifying that the software meets requirements and identifying defects.
Deployment: Installing the software in the production environment.
Maintenance: Enhancing, fixing, and adapting the software over time1.
Agile vs. Waterfall Models:
Agile:
Iterative and flexible approach.
Emphasizes collaboration, adaptability, and customer feedback.
Suits dynamic projects with changing requirements.
Waterfall:
Sequential and rigid approach.
Phases follow a linear order (requirements, design, implementation, testing, deployment).
